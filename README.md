# Machine Learning by Columbia University on edX

The course [website](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-2)

Based on the lecture notes of the course ([link](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/W4721/Spring2017/W4721Spring2017.html)), for each project I created a Jupyter Notebook briefly introducing the theory. Moreover I added an application of the given algorithm to a real (or generated, in case of clustering algorithms) dataset.
