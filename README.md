# edX Machine Learning by Columbia University

In this repository you can find the course projects I have written in Python.

Based on the lecture notes of the course ([link](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/W4721/Spring2017/W4721Spring2017.html)), for each project I created a Jupyter Notebook where I gave an introduction together with the relevant theory. Moreover, in the notebook you can also find an application of the given algorithm(s) to a real (or generated, in case of clustering algorithms) dataset.

More details can be found at the link above or on the edX course [website](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-2).

## Projects:
1. Ridge regression
2. Plug-in (Bayes) classifier
3. k-means clustering algorithm and the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture model
4. Collaborative filtering via probabilistic matrix factorization
