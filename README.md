# edX Machine Learning by Columbia University

In this repository you can find the course projects I have written in Python.

Based on the lecture notes of the course ([link](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/W4721/Spring2017/W4721Spring2017.html)), for each project I created a Jupyter Notebook where I gave an introduction together with the relevant theory. Moreover, in the notebook you can also find an application of the given algorithm(s) to a real (or generated, in case of clustering algorithms) dataset.

More details can be found at the link above or on the edX course [website](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-2).

## Projects:

### 1. Regression : ridge regression
Applied to [Wine Quality dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).
### 2. Classification: plug-in (Bayes) classifier
Applied to [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
### 3. Clustering: k-means and the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture model
Applied to a dataset randomly generated from a few Gaussians.
### 4. Collaborative filtering: probabilistic matrix factorization
Applied to [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
